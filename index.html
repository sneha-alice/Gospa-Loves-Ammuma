A Second Dad
Even though you're not my dad I know that you'll be there
with the little things you do
you let me know you care.

You're always there to help,
whatever the need may be
you've given of yourself...
and so unselfishly

Now you're becoming the dad that I have never known
I'm drawn to you more every day
for the kindness you have shown

I just want to thank you and let you know I care
A second dad as great as you is something very rare.
Love You Dad!.<br>

<p>Honey,

This is my favorite moment of the year. Do you know why? Because I could not imagine my world without you inside of it. I am so thankful I met you and I am thankful to your parents for creating such an intelligent, respectful, compassionate man. I hope this day is extra special. You deserve it</p>
